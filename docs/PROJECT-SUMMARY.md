**Status**: 100% Complete (123/123 points) ✅ - Deployed to Device

> For detailed epic-by-epic progress tracking, see [Core-Backlog-Progress.md](Core-Backlog-Progress.md)

## Overview

WhatsNext is a modern iOS messaging application built with SwiftUI and Supabase. Phase 1 (Core) is **100% complete** with all features implemented and the app successfully deployed to a physical iPhone device.

**Completed**: All 11 epics (123/123 story points) ✅
- E1: Foundation & Repo Setup
- E2: Supabase Schema & RLS
- E3: iOS App Bootstrap (corrected & restructured)
- E4: Authentication & Profile
- E5: Conversations & Chat Core
- E6: Realtime Messaging
- E7: Offline & Local Persistence
- E8: Read Receipts
- E9: Group Chat Management
- E10: Push Notifications (APNs)
- E11: Release Configuration & Polish

**Current State**: App running on iPhone 17,2 (iOS 26.0) with full Supabase integration

**Critical Update**: Epic E3 was corrected from an incorrect Swift Package library implementation to a proper iOS app with workspace + package architecture using XcodeBuildMCP scaffolding. All code migrated to new structure at `ios/WhatsNext/`.

## Technical Achievements

### Architecture Highlights

**MVVM Pattern**: Clean separation of concerns with @MainActor ViewModels isolating UI state from business logic.

**Service Layer**: Dedicated services for each domain:
- `AuthService` - Authentication and session management
- `ConversationService` - Conversation CRUD and participant management
- `MessageService` - Message operations and read receipts
- `RealtimeService` - WebSocket subscription lifecycle
- `LocalStorageService` - SwiftData persistence layer
- `MessageSyncService` - Outbox pattern for offline resilience
- `PushNotificationService` - APNs token registration and handling
- `SupabaseClientService` - Singleton Supabase client with Config.plist loading

**Offline-First**: SwiftData + outbox pattern ensures messages queue offline and sync automatically on reconnection. Network monitor triggers sync on connectivity changes.

**Real-time**: WebSocket subscriptions filtered by conversation ID for efficient message delivery. Typing indicators expire after 5 seconds. Subscription cleanup on view dismissal prevents leaks.

**Optimistic UI**: Messages appear instantly with local ID, reconcile to server ID on response. Deduplication prevents showing the same message twice from optimistic + realtime channels.

### Code Quality

- **Type Safety**: Codable models throughout with proper error handling
- **Modern Swift**: Async/await (no completion handlers), actor isolation where appropriate
- **SwiftUI Best Practices**: StateObject for ownership, EnvironmentObject for dependency injection
- **Structured Logging**: OSLog categories (Auth, Network, Database, Messaging, Realtime, Sync, UI)
- **Error Tracking**: Centralized ErrorTracker collecting last 50 errors with context

### Database Design

**Schema**: 6 normalized tables with proper foreign keys:
- `users` - Profiles with push tokens
- `conversations` - 1:1 and group chats
- `conversation_participants` - Many-to-many with last_read_at
- `messages` - Content with soft delete via deleted_at
- `typing_indicators` - Ephemeral state (5s TTL)
- `read_receipts` - Per-user read tracking

**Security**: Row-Level Security (RLS) on all tables enforcing:
- Users can only read public profiles, update their own
- Conversation access limited to participants
- Messages filtered by participant membership
- Read receipts only insertable for own user_id

**Performance**: Indexes on common query patterns (conversation_id + created_at, user_id, local_id). Triggers auto-update `conversations.updated_at` on message insert.

### Performance Considerations

- **Lazy Loading**: Pagination with 50-message limit and `before` cursor
- **Optimistic UI**: Instant perceived speed, reconcile asynchronously
- **Local Caching**: SwiftData models mirror remote data for offline access
- **Filtered Subscriptions**: Real-time subscriptions scoped to single conversation
- **Message Deduplication**: Track optimistic messages separately to prevent duplicates

## Lessons Learned

### What Went Well

**Supabase Integration**: Swift SDK (2.0+) worked smoothly. Auth, Realtime, and Postgres client all straightforward to use.

**SwiftData**: Modern, type-safe persistence with @Model macro. No boilerplate compared to Core Data.

**Realtime**: WebSocket subscriptions reliable with good filtering capabilities. Postgres changes feature excellent for reactive updates.

**Async/await**: Clean, readable async code throughout. No callback hell or Combine complexity.

**Epic-Based Approach**: Breaking into 11 epics with story points kept scope manageable and progress measurable.

**XcodeBuildMCP**: Automated iOS build and deployment pipeline enabled rapid device testing and streamlined the development workflow. Invaluable for device-specific features like push notifications.

**Workspace + Package Architecture**: Clean separation between app shell and feature code enables modular development and easier testing.

### Challenges Overcome

**Optimistic UI Reconciliation**: Solved with localId pattern - generate UUID client-side, send to server, reconcile on response by matching localId.

**Message Deduplication**: Track optimistic messages in separate dictionary. When realtime message arrives, check localId and replace optimistic version.

**Network Monitoring**: NetworkMonitor observes NWPathMonitor and publishes connectivity changes. MessageSyncService subscribes and triggers outbox sync on reconnection.

**SwiftData Relationships**: Avoided @Relationship (immature). Used UUIDs and manual joins instead. More verbose but more reliable.

**Typing Indicator Expiration**: Timer-based cleanup checks every 2 seconds. Fetch fresh indicators from server (5-second window). Alternative: track timestamp per user locally.

**Epic E3 Project Structure**: Original implementation created Swift Package `.library` instead of iOS app, making device deployment impossible. Solved by scaffolding proper iOS app with XcodeBuildMCP and migrating all 25 Swift files to workspace + package architecture.

**Supabase Configuration**: Info.plist custom keys don't inject reliably with auto-generated plists. Solved by creating bundled Config.plist and reading via `Bundle.module`, providing cleaner configuration management.

**Swift Concurrency Migration**: New scaffold used Swift 6.1 with strict concurrency, incompatible with existing Swift 5.9 MVVM code. Downgraded swift-tools-version to 5.9 for compatibility.

**Public Access Control**: SPM packages require explicit `public` modifiers for cross-module access. Systematically added public to all types and methods used by app target.

### Technical Debt

**Testing**: No unit tests or UI tests yet. Add before production for service layer and critical flows.

**Error Handling**: Some services could have more granular error types and recovery strategies.

**Accessibility**: VoiceOver labels and Dynamic Type not implemented. Required for App Store approval.

**Localization**: Hard-coded English strings. Add NSLocalizedString before international launch.

**Analytics**: No crash reporting or usage metrics. Integrate Sentry or Firebase before production.

## Recommendations

### Before Production

1. **Testing**: Unit tests for services, UI tests for auth/chat flows
2. **Analytics**: Crash reporting (Sentry/Firebase) and usage metrics
3. **Monitoring**: Supabase project monitoring, alert on high error rates
4. **Backup**: Database backup strategy and disaster recovery plan
5. **Privacy**: Privacy policy, data handling disclosure, GDPR compliance
6. **Accessibility**: VoiceOver pass, Dynamic Type support
7. **Localization**: i18n for multi-language support

### Deployment Status

✅ **All epics completed** (123/123 story points)
✅ **App running on physical device** (iPhone 17,2, iOS 26.0)
✅ **Supabase integration verified**
✅ **Push notification capability enabled** (device only)
✅ **Ready for production testing**

### Post-MVP Enhancements

**Media Messages**: Image/video/file sharing with Supabase Storage
**Voice Messages**: Audio recording and playback
**Message Reactions**: Emoji reactions with optimistic UI
**Search**: Full-text search across messages
**Message Editing**: Edit/delete sent messages with timestamps
**User Search**: Find users to start conversations
**Rich Notifications**: Notification actions (reply, mark read)
**Message Forwarding**: Forward to other conversations
**Contact Integration**: Sync phone contacts
**Disappearing Messages**: Auto-delete after time period

### Phase 2 - AI Integration

See [AI-Implementation-Spec.md](AI-Implementation-Spec.md) for complete Phase 2 plan:
- **Message Enhancement**: Rewrite for clarity, tone, or length
