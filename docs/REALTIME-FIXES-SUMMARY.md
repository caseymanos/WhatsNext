## 🏗️ Architecture Improvements

### Subscription Management

**Proper Lifecycle:**
1. Subscribe on view appear / conversation fetch
2. Handle events via callbacks
3. Update UI via @Published properties
4. Unsubscribe in deinit

**Memory Safety:**
- Weak self captures in closures
- Proper task cancellation
- Channel cleanup in deinit
- No subscription leaks

### Channel Strategy

| Channel Name | Purpose | Lifecycle |
|-------------|---------|-----------|
| `messages:{conversationId}` | Individual chat messages | Per conversation |
| `typing:{conversationId}` | Typing indicators | Per conversation |
| `read_receipts:{conversationId}` | Read status updates | Per conversation |
| `conversation_updates:{userId}` | Conversation metadata | Per user session |
| `all_messages:{userId}` | Global message stream | Per user session |
